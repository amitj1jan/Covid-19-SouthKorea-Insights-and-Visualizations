# Covid-19-SouthKorea-Insights-and-Visualizations
#This project is effort to find the insights from Covid-19 datasets provided by SouthKorea. https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset  I have tried to find if there are any correlations and if yes do they apply causation. Also create some cool geospatial visualizations to track the covid-19 patients routes and visualize the covid-19 hotspots.
